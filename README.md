# Hola, Bonjour, Hi 👋  
### I'm Ronny Ascencio

🎬 **Digital Artist turned Python Developer**  
🐍 Building tools & pipelines for **VFX / Animation / CG**  
📍 Based in **Montreal, QC (Canada)**  

---

## 🧠 About me

I come from the **art side of VFX** — compositor, cinematography background, paint & roto —  
and I’m transitioning into **pipeline & tools development** with Python.

What drives me is **bridging artists and code**:
- tools that *artists actually want to use*
- pipelines that are **simple, modular, and realistic for small teams**
- learning by **building real things**, not tutorials-only projects

I may be early in my **software career**, but I work with **production mindset**, discipline, and long-term vision.

---

## 🚀 What I'm focused on right now

- 🧩 Designing a **modular VFX pipeline** (open source)
- 🐍 Writing clean, maintainable **Python for DCCs**
- 🎥 Learning **OpenUSD, lighting & lookdev** from a technical artist perspective
- 🛠 Improving **developer workflows** (CLI tools, environments, configs)

## ⭐ Featured project

### 🧬 Xolo Pipeline
**An open-source VFX pipeline for freelancers, artists, and small studios**

🔗 GitHub: https://github.com/xololab/xolo-pipeline  

**Why it matters**
- Inspired by real production needs (not over-engineered)
- Focus on **clarity, portability, and ease of installation**
- Designed for **Blender, Gaffer, Nuke**, with future scalability

**What I’m learning through this project**
- Pipeline architecture & structure
- CLI design with `typer`
- Environment management (`uv`, future Rez exploration)
- DCC integration patterns
- Writing code meant to be read, used, and extended by others

This project represents **how I think and how I work**.

## 🧑‍🎨 Why my background matters

I’m not just learning to code —  
I understand **artists’ pain points** because I’ve been one.

That means:
- I design tools with **UX in mind**
- I value **clear defaults over complex configs**
- I communicate well between **technical and artistic teams**

This hybrid profile is what I’m intentionally building.

## 🤝 Open to

- Junior / Entry-level **Pipeline TD**
- Tools Developer (Python)
- Technical Artist roles
- Open-source collaboration
- Mentorship & code reviews

I’m especially interested in teams that value **learning, clean foundations, and collaboration**.
